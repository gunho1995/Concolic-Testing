# Pre_ConcTest


## Abstract
  We present a new tool, named Shin Tool, for  testing C program running on a Real Time Operating System board. Shin tool overcomes disadvantage of running testing tool on an embedded system. Executing testing tool directly on the board limits the usage of memory and testing credibility. To improve, we use four steps: (1) seperate target program on the board and testing tool on the server; (2) scan thorough target program and find corresponding testing module on the server; (3) call corresponding testing module on the target program, detect faults on the program; (4) send back collected faults on the target program to the server. During testing, Shin Tool detects both hardware malfunction and software faults at real time. Using Shin tool, efficient memory utilization on embedded system and generating more reliable program are expected.
